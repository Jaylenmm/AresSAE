# Slip Reader Accuracy Improvements

## What I Just Added:

### 1. **PrizePicks/DFS Format Support**
- Added specialized parser for PrizePicks, Underdog, Sleeper, etc.
- Detects "More/Less" format instead of traditional odds
- Extracts player props without odds (assumes -110)
- Better handling of stat types (pts, yds, assists, rebounds)

### 2. **Debug Mode**
- Click "üîç Show extracted text (debug)" to see what OCR extracted
- This helps identify parsing issues
- Check console logs in Vercel for detailed parsing info

### 3. **Enhanced Sportsbook Detection**
- Added: PrizePicks, Underdog, Sleeper, ParlayPlay, Betr
- Better keyword matching

## How to Test Improvements:

1. **Upload a PrizePicks slip**
2. **Click the debug dropdown** to see extracted text
3. **Check what was parsed** vs what should have been parsed
4. **Share the debug text with me** if it's still not working

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "No bets found"
**Causes:**
- Image quality too low
- Text not clear enough
- Format not recognized

**Solutions:**
- Take screenshot in good lighting
- Make sure text is large and clear
- Crop image to just the bet slip area
- Try different angle if photo

### Issue: Player names not matching
**Causes:**
- OCR misread name (e.g., "Mahomes" ‚Üí "Mahommes")
- Database has different format (e.g., "Patrick Mahomes" vs "P. Mahomes")

**Solutions:**
- Fuzzy matching should handle small typos
- If match confidence < 50%, bet won't analyze
- May need to manually verify player names

### Issue: PrizePicks not detecting
**Causes:**
- "PrizePicks" text not in image
- "More/Less" keywords not detected

**Solutions:**
- Make sure sportsbook name is visible
- Ensure "More" or "Less" text is clear
- Check debug output to see what was extracted

## Tips for Better Accuracy:

### üì∏ **Taking Photos:**
1. **Good lighting** - avoid shadows
2. **Straight angle** - not tilted
3. **Fill the frame** - bet slip should be 80%+ of image
4. **Focus** - make sure text is sharp
5. **Crop** - remove unnecessary parts

### üì± **Screenshot Tips:**
1. **Full screen** the bet slip
2. **Hide notifications/overlays**
3. **Make sure all bets are visible**
4. **Don't cut off any text**

### üéØ **Best Formats:**
- ‚úÖ PrizePicks - Now supported!
- ‚úÖ FanDuel - Works well
- ‚úÖ DraftKings - Works well
- ‚úÖ BetMGM - Works well
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Caesars - Sometimes tricky
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Underdog - Now supported!

## Next Steps for Even Better Accuracy:

### Option 1: Add More Training Data
- Collect sample bet slips from each sportsbook
- Create parser rules for each format
- Test and refine

### Option 2: Use GPT-4 Vision (More Expensive)
- $0.01 per image (vs $0.0015 for Google Vision)
- Better at understanding context
- Can handle more complex layouts
- Would require OpenAI API key

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use Google Vision for OCR
- Use GPT-4 to parse the extracted text
- Best of both worlds
- Moderate cost increase

### Option 4: Manual Correction UI
- Show extracted bets
- Let user correct before analyzing
- Highest accuracy
- More user friction

## Debugging Workflow:

1. **Upload slip**
2. **Click debug dropdown**
3. **Copy extracted text**
4. **Check what should have been parsed:**
   - Player names
   - Stat types
   - Line values
   - Over/Under or More/Less
5. **Share with me if issues persist**

## Cost Monitoring:

Current setup (Google Vision):
- **Free tier:** 1,000 images/month
- **After free tier:** $1.50 per 1,000 images
- **Example:** 100 users √ó 10 slips/month = 1,000 images = FREE

If we add GPT-4 Vision:
- **Cost:** $0.01 per image
- **Example:** 1,000 images = $10/month

## Performance Metrics to Track:

- **OCR Success Rate:** % of images with text extracted
- **Parse Success Rate:** % of extracted text with bets found
- **Match Success Rate:** % of bets matched to database
- **Analysis Success Rate:** % of matched bets analyzed
- **Overall Success Rate:** End-to-end success

Target: 80%+ overall success rate

## What to Send Me for Debugging:

If a slip isn't working:
1. Screenshot of the bet slip
2. The extracted text from debug dropdown
3. What bets SHOULD have been found
4. What sportsbook it's from

I can then improve the parser for that specific format!
